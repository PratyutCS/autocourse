[{"filename":"1733380100Xai.pdf","done":1,"Program":"CSE","Session":"7th Sem","course_code":"CSE3023","course_name":"XAI: Explainable AI","Module/Semester":"Core Elective","course_description":"The Explainable AI (XAI) course focuses on the principles and practices essential for understanding and interpreting AI systems. It covers foundational topics in machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and large language models, emphasizing techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), saliency maps, and attention mechanisms. Students will learn to apply these tools to make complex AI models more transparent and interpretable, addressing both ethical and social implications.\n\nThis course integrates theoretical knowledge with practical applications, providing insights into the challenges and future directions of XAI, including its application to generative models and large language models. Students will gain skills in interpreting AI decisions, understanding various XAI techniques, and communicating findings to stakeholders. Through real-world case studies and practical exercises, participants will develop the expertise needed to enhance the transparency and accountability of AI systems.","Course Syllabus":[{"srNo":1,"content":"INTRODUCTION TO XAI","co":"1","sessions":5},{"srNo":2,"content":"INTERPRETABILITY METHODS & MODEL-AGNOSTIC XAI","co":"1","sessions":4},{"srNo":3,"content":"INTERACTIVE MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES & DEEP EXPLANATION TECHNIQUES","co":"2","sessions":4},{"srNo":4,"content":"POSTHOC EXPLANATION APPROACHES & ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN XAI","co":"2","sessions":3},{"srNo":5,"content":"USER-CENTRIC XAI AND EVALUATION","co":"3","sessions":3},{"srNo":6,"content":"GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (GANs) AND GENERATIVE AI (GenXAI) IN EXPLAINABLE AI","co":"2","sessions":2}],"Learning Resources":{"textBooks":["Denis Rothman.
