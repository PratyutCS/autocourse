Students will learn how to design, train, and deploy generative AI systems, with a particular emphasis on Large Language Models. They will explore the principles, applications, and ethical considerations surrounding these technologies. The course describes in detail the transformer architecture that powers LLMs, how they\u2019re trained, and how fine-tuning enables LLMs to be adapted to a variety of specific use cases.",

    "course_description": "This course aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of generative artificial intelligence, focusing on large language models. Students will learn how to design, train, and deploy generative AI systems, with a particular emphasis on Large Language Models. They will explore the principles, applications, and ethical considerations surrounding these technologies. The course describes in detail the transformer architecture that powers LLMs, how they\u2019re trained, and how fine-tuning enables LLMs to be adapted to a variety of specific use cases.",
