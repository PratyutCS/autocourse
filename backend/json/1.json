[{"filename":"1732678122Abhimanyu Singh Rana_Handout QMT_2024.pdf","done":1,"course_code":"PHY4706","course_name":"Quantum Matter & Technologies (QM&T)","course_description":"Recently, many advances in quantum technologies (based on some interesting concepts of quantum physics and matter) have emerged where big companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM and Facebook are taking interest due to the impact of these technologies beyond the imagination of a layman. In quantum physics, it is quite evident that whether it makes sense or not, but it “works”. Some concepts still look far sighted now where the quantum physics proposes that it is possible to have a communication far beyond using conventional technologies (in a very robust manner without losing the information) or the state can’t be just defined as 0 and 1 (used in current computation) but the infinite states between 0 and 1 (giving extremely fast and accurate calculations). However, all these discoveries will depend on the progress made in the manipulation and development of quantum matter at atomic scales. In this course, I will take this journey from this fascinating physics to some serious applications in quantum information processing devices and computing. As the course is UG, there will be less use to rigorous mathematics and wherever it appears it will be explained at simpler level. Many activities such programming a real quantum computer through remote IBM Quantum Experience (https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) and experiments will be performed in class itself. The difficult concepts will be explained with help of videos and animations. The practice and focus on problems will be done through take-home assignments (which will be major component of internal marks).","Course Syllabus":[{"srNo":1,"content":"Fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics Particles and Waves, Uncertainty Principle, Wavefunctions, Superposition Principle, Schrodinger Equation, Quantum Tunneling, Quantum Entanglement","co":"1","sessions":2},{"srNo":2,"content":"Quantum Matter, Devices and Measurement Technologies Quantum Dots, Nanostructures, 2-D Materials, Quantum Hall Effect, Superconductors, Tunneling Devices (Josephson junctions, STM, SQUID etc.) Ion-traps","co":"1","sessions":2},{"srNo":3,"content":"Quantum Information Processing and Computing Technologies Qubits, Bloch Sphere, Quatum Logic Gates (X, Y, Z, H, CNOTetc), Basic architecture of quantum computing and examples of Quantum Algorithms (Bernstein–Vazirani, Shor’s Algorithm etc)","co":"2","sessions":2},{"srNo":4,"content":"Programming a Quantum Computer, Lab Projects","co":"2","sessions":2}],"Learning Resources":{"textBooks":["David J.
