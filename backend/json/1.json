Therefore, it is mandatory to develop a good understanding of their operation and how they can be used as building blocks for automated systems and control applications. This course explores the inner workings of a microcontroller from the programmer\\u2019s perspective for which the course is divided into three main sections; (a) Introduction to sensors, their signal conditioning and actuators (b) Microcontroller embedded C programming (c) Sensors and actuator interfacing.","Course Syllabus":[{"srNo":1,"content":"Introduction to various types of sensors: LDR,
