Students will learn how to design, train, and deploy generative AI systems, with a particular emphasis on Large Language Models. They will explore the principles, applications, and ethical considerations surrounding these technologies. The course describes in detail the transformer architecture that powers LLMs, how they’re trained, and how fine-tuning enables LLMs to be adapted to a variety of specific use cases.","Course Syllabus":[{"srNo":1,"content":"Generative AI: What is generative AI, Different types of generative AI models, Understand the principles and applications of Generative AI in creating new data instances, Understand the principles behind Generative AI: Get familiar with building and tweaking generative models for any real-world use case.
