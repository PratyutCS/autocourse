[{"filename":"1740972177CourseHandout(Seminar Case Study Bactch 2021-25).pdf","done":1,"Program":10,"course_name":"Seminar/Case Studies","course_description":"The main objective of this course is to introduce students to different data structures and illustrate their effective use in solving technical and logical problems. The course comprehensively explores different problem-solving techniques and skills. Proficiency in problem-solving skills is a fundamental expectation for any competent developer, as these concepts are commonly assessed by reputable companies during the screening process for software developer positions. The primary emphasis will be on achieving a deep understanding of data structures, their implementation, practical applications through problem-solving scenarios, exploring various programming paradigms, algorithm analysis, and the practical application of different data structures and algorithms. This course explores the fundamental workings of algorithms and data structures, which lie at its core essence.","Course Syllabus":[{"srNo":1,"content":"Linear Search, Maximum in an Array,
