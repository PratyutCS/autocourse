To understand the concepts of root level microcontroller programming in C so that they can write the customized programs for different real-world applications. Sensors and microcontrollers are the key to automate and incorporate intelligence in automatic systems which are used for real time operations. Therefore, it is mandatory to develop a good understanding of their operation and how they can be used as building blocks for automated systems and control applications. This course explores the inner workings of a microcontroller from the programmer’s perspective.","Learning Resources":{"textBooks":["Muhammad Ali Mazidi., \"AVR microcontroller and Embedded systems using assembly and C\", Prentice Hall","\"Richard H., \"Embedded C programing and the ATMEL AVR\", Thompson Delmar learning"],"referenceLinks":["The Intel ATMega 328 datasheet"]},"internalAssessmentData":{"components":{}},"copoMappingData":{"courseOutcomes":{"CO1":{"description":"Understand the fundamentals of various sensors and their signal conditioning operations.","bullets":[]},"CO2":{"description":"Analyze various types of microcontroller development boards in terms of their architectures and programming.","bullets":[]},"CO3":{"description":"Apply the concepts of microcontroller programming for interfacing of various sensors, actuators and other peripherals.","bullets":[]}},"mappingData":{"CO1":{"PO1":"2","PO2":"1","PO3":"1","PO4":"2","PO5":"0","PO6":"0","PO7":"0","PO8":"0","PO9":"0","PO10":"0","PO11":"0","PO12":"0","PSO1":"0","PSO2":"0","PSO3":"0","PSO4":"0"},"CO2":{"PO1":"0","PO2":"0","PO3":"0","PO4":"0","PO5":"0","PO6":"0","PO7":"0","PO8":"0","PO9":"0","PO10":"0","PO11":"0","PO12":"0","PSO1":"0","PSO2":"0","PSO3":"0","PSO4":"0"},"CO3":{"PO1":"0","PO2":"0","PO3":"0","PO4":"0","PO5":"0","PO6":"0","PO7":"0","PO8":"0","PO9":"0","PO10":"0","PO11":"0","PO12":"0","PSO1":"0","PSO2":"0","PSO3":"0","PSO4":"0"}}},"actionsForWeakStudentsData":[""],"coWeightages":{"CO1":{"quiz(30)":"70","project(30)":"0","end term(40)":"10"},"CO2":{"quiz(30)":"30","project(30)":"65","end term(40)":"20"},"CO3":{"quiz(30)":"0","project(30)":"35","end term(40)":"70"}},"course_syllabus":[{"srNo":1,"content":"","co":"","sessions":""}],"Course Syllabus":[{"srNo":1,"content":"","co":"","sessions":""}],"coAttainmentCriteria":{"CO1":{"full":"85","partial":"75"},"CO2":{"full":"85","partial":"75"},"CO3":{"full":"85","partial":"75"}},"studentData":{"maxMarks":{"Quiz(30)":30,"project(30)":30,"End Term(40)":40,"Total Marks(100.0)":100},"data":[{"Sr No.":1,"Unique Id.":240334,"Student Name":"Aditya Goel","Quiz(30)":28,"project(30)":27,"End Term(40)":28,"Total Marks(100.0)":83,"Grading":"a+","Attendance":88},{"Sr No.":2,"Unique Id.":240335,"Student Name":"Anisha Chhanpadia","Quiz(30)":23,"project(30)":23,"End Term(40)":30,"Total Marks(100.0)":76,"Grading":"a+","Attendance":87},{"Sr No.":3,"Unique Id.":240336,"Student Name":"Dhruv Singla","Quiz(30)":25,"project(30)":22,"End Term(40)":33,"Total Marks(100.0)":80,"Grading":"a+","Attendance":93},{"Sr No.":4,"Unique Id.":240337,"Student Name":"Dorjee Phinjo Sona","Quiz(30)":24,"project(30)":30,"End Term(40)":20,"Total Marks(100.0)":74,"Grading":"a+","Attendance":88},{"Sr No.":5,"Unique Id.":240338,"Student Name":"EENA CHAUDHARY","Quiz(30)":21,"project(30)":24,"End Term(40)":20,"Total Marks(100.0)":65,"Grading":"a+","Attendance":77},{"Sr No.":6,"Unique Id.":240339,"Student Name":"Eshaan Chandra","Quiz(30)":26,"project(30)":29,"End Term(40)":26,"Total Marks(100.0)":81,"Grading":"a+","Attendance":88},{"Sr No.":7,"Unique Id.":240340,"Student Name":"Hardik Rustagi","Quiz(30)":24,"project(30)":27,"End Term(40)":20,"Total Marks(100.0)":71,"Grading":"a+","Attendance":99},{"Sr No.":8,"Unique Id.":240341,"Student Name":"Harsh Gupta","Quiz(30)":30,"project(30)":29,"End Term(40)":33,"Total Marks(100.0)":92,"Grading":"a+","Attendance":81},{"Sr No.":9,"Unique Id.":240342,"Student Name":"Jiya Gera","Quiz(30)":25,"project(30)":20,"End Term(40)":20,"Total Marks(100.0)":65,"Grading":"a+","Attendance":92},{"Sr No.":10,"Unique Id.":240343,"Student Name":"Keshav Gupta","Quiz(30)":25,"project(30)":20,"End Term(40)":40,"Total Marks(100.0)":85,"Grading":"a+","Attendance":93}]},"studentListData":[],"weakStudentsData":[],"marksDetailsData":[],"attendanceReportData":[]}]
