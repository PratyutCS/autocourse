        "facultyCourseReview": "I had positive feedback from the class, especially regarding the assessments. I had assessments after every major component of the course was covered. A key element of the evaluation involved a project-based approach. In one of the assessments, students were asked to simulate registering an LLP. They were to research the steps of registering an LLP and complete the due diligence required. In another assessment, they negotiated a contract. This real-life scenario helped them understand the nuances of contract negotiation. Another assessment involved role-playing as a seller and a buyer under the Sales of Goods Act. \n\nCreating a Google Classroom page for the course helped me in uploading all the material in one place. I was able to ask small questions on it at the end of every topic. This exercise was appreciated by the students as it helped them revise the topic covered in the class. By the end of the semester, I had asked 20 questions. To encourage the students to answer these questions, I made this the criteria for awarding the class participation marks.\n",
